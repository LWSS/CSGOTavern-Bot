# CSGOTavern-Bot

Item bot for CSGOTavern item site: https://github.com/LWSS/CSGOTavern

Learned node.js for this project, was my first nodejs project, might not be the best of code. 
If the server is unable to be contacted, it goes in a recursive loop checking for it. Would recommend upgrading this.

Also multi item transfers are not done if I recall correctly.
